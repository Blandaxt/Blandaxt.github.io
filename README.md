## Sample Projects:

[![Enthusiasm](http://alain-lafume.bitballoon.com/carousel/image/image1.jpg)](http://alain-lafume.bitballoon.com/carousel/index.html)

*The Carousel* Was one of the first projects i was proud amazed that i could complete it all alone without much help. I did not understand completely how each file type like the JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheet and Hyper Text Mark Up Language were connecting with each other until i did some research on for loops.

**[Blurb](http://alain-lafume.bitballoon.com/blurb/)**
A little bit about me and my goals/interest.


## How It's Made:

*Tech used:* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap.

1. I created this portfolio by first downloading a framework from bootstrap. Then i start to modify the HTML To fit to my liking such as including my name in the title, and changing the footer by removing undesired CSS.

2. Then i start to include my projects and linking them using an href tag. This part took me a while because bootstrap by default is linked to it's minimize file instead of the full file. So i had to dig through many smushed code to find the right place to input my links.

3. Finally i change some images that fit the design choice of my images more so it can be represented easily upon sight. Projects like my *traffic light* that had a traffic light as a background picture, or my *todo* list which has a list as the picture.  

## About
This portfolio Features Some of my latest work. Such as my carousel, horoscope, farm and slot machine. This portfolio is not complete. If i had more time i would include a video of me creating a project. I would also include a google maps api that i am working on. I have many more ideas such as an art canvas where visitors can publish a small artwork and submit comments on what they think. Please email me Lafumealain@gmail.com to tell me what you think.
