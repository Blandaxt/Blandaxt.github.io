      <h1>ALAIN LAFUME</h1>

      <p>A few years after arriving in America, I received my first video game and fell in love with the complexity of how users interacted with pre-set stories. This fascination carried into my adulthood, where I played online games (MMORPGâ€™s or MMOFPS) competitively. My favorite game, Fantasy Earth, unfortunately closed down due to its lack of proper security measures, thus making the site vulnerable to hackers. As a former computer science major, I decided it was time to pick up where I started and learn the best technologies used to protect programs from attacks. Now at Resilient Coders, I am taking the first step by becoming a full-stack developer. I would love the opportunity to create interactive products that are built with security in mind from the ground up.</p>
